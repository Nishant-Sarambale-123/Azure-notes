Perfect ‚úÖ Thanks for sharing the topics. I‚Äôll give you **detailed notes**, followed by **interview Q\&A** (basic ‚Üí advanced), and finally **scenario-based Q\&A** for these Azure basics.

# üìò Microsoft Azure Notes

## 1. **Azure Basics**

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Types: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

* **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

  * Provides virtualized computing resources like VMs, storage, and networks.
  * Example: Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Virtual Network.
  * You manage: OS, applications, runtime.
  * Cloud provider manages: hardware, datacenter, networking.

* **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

  * Provides a ready-to-use platform for building, testing, and deploying applications.
  * Example: Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database.
  * You manage: application code, configuration.
  * Cloud provider manages: infrastructure, OS, runtime, middleware.

* **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

  * Ready-to-use software delivered over the internet.
  * Example: Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365.
  * Everything managed by the provider; user just consumes the service.

---

### üåç Azure Regions & Availability Zones

* **Region** = Geographical area with multiple datacenters.

  * Example: *East US, West Europe, Central India.*
* **Availability Zone (AZ)** = Physically separate datacenter within a region.

  * Each AZ has its own power, cooling, networking.
  * At least 3 AZs per supported region.
  * Provides high availability (99.99% uptime SLA for zonal services).
* **Region Pairing**: Azure pairs regions within the same geography (e.g., East US ‚Üî West US).

  * Used for disaster recovery, automatic failover, and updates.

---

### üì¶ Resource Groups (RGs)

* A **logical container** for Azure resources (VMs, storage accounts, databases).
* Helps with **organization, access control, billing, and lifecycle management.**
* Resources must belong to exactly one RG.
* If you delete a resource group ‚Üí all resources inside are deleted.
* Best practice: group resources by application/workload.

---

### üîß Azure Management Tools

* **Azure Portal**

  * Web-based GUI for managing resources.
  * Easy to use, good for beginners, but less automation.

* **Azure CLI (`az`)**

  * Command-line tool for scripting and automation.
  * Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac).
  * Example: `az vm create ‚Ä¶`

* **Azure PowerShell**

  * Similar to CLI, but works with PowerShell modules.
  * Preferred by Windows admins.

* **ARM Templates (Azure Resource Manager)**

  * JSON-based IaC (Infrastructure as Code) templates.
  * Declarative: ‚ÄúWhat to deploy‚Äù not ‚Äúhow to deploy.‚Äù

* **Bicep**

  * Domain Specific Language (DSL) for IaC.
  * Simplifies ARM templates (less verbose).
  * Example: `resource myVM 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines@2021-07-01' = { ‚Ä¶ }`

---

### üìë Subscriptions & Management Groups

* **Subscription**

  * Unit of billing, access control, and resource limits.
  * Each subscription has a unique ID.
  * Example: Dev, Test, Production subscriptions.

* **Management Group**

  * Container to organize multiple subscriptions.
  * Policies and RBAC can be applied at management group level.
  * Helps large organizations with multiple subscriptions.

# üéØ Interview Questions & Answers

### Basic

1. **Q: Difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS with examples?**

   * A: IaaS = VM (control OS). PaaS = App Service (just deploy code). SaaS = Office 365 (use ready software).

2. **Q: What is a Resource Group in Azure?**

   * A: A logical container for resources, used for organization, billing, and lifecycle management.

3. **Q: What‚Äôs the difference between Azure CLI and PowerShell?**

   * A: CLI is cross-platform and uses simple commands. PowerShell is Windows-centric and uses cmdlets, good for Windows admins.

---

### Intermediate

4. **Q: What are Availability Zones? Why are they important?**

   * A: Independent datacenters within a region that provide redundancy and high availability. Protects apps from datacenter-level failures.

5. **Q: How do ARM templates differ from Bicep?**

   * A: ARM templates use JSON and are verbose. Bicep is a DSL that simplifies writing IaC but compiles into ARM JSON.

6. **Q: How do subscriptions and management groups differ?**

   * A: Subscriptions = billing boundary. Management Groups = hierarchical container to organize multiple subscriptions and apply policies/RBAC.

---

### Advanced

7. **Q: How would you design a highly available application in Azure?**

   * A: Deploy across multiple AZs in a region. Use Azure Load Balancer / App Gateway for traffic distribution. For DR, use region pairing.

8. **Q: When would you use multiple resource groups?**

   * A: For separating lifecycle management (e.g., network in one RG, app in another), RBAC requirements, or billing separation.

# üõ† Scenario-Based Q\&A

1. **Scenario**: Your application must run even if one datacenter goes down. How would you design it in Azure?

   * **Answer**: Deploy VMs across multiple Availability Zones in a region, or across paired regions. Use a load balancer for distributing traffic.

2. **Scenario**: Your organization has 5 subscriptions (Dev, QA, UAT, Prod, Security). How do you apply company-wide policies (like no public IPs)?

   * **Answer**: Create a Management Group, place all subscriptions inside, and apply Azure Policy at the management group level.

3. **Scenario**: You want to automate deploying 100 resources repeatedly for different environments. Which tool would you choose and why?

   * **Answer**: Use Bicep (preferred) or ARM templates since they provide IaC. CLI/PowerShell are better for one-off scripting, not for repeatable infra.

üëâ Would you like me to continue this same way for the **next Azure topics** (like Azure Networking, Storage, Compute, Security, Monitoring, etc.), so you‚Äôll have a **full interview-ready Azure notes set**?
