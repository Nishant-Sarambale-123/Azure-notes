# üìò Core Azure Services ‚Äì Compute

## üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machines (VMs)

* **IaaS offering** ‚Üí Full control over OS, applications, and networking.
* **VM Sizes**:

  * General-purpose (B, D series).
  * Compute-optimized (F series).
  * Memory-optimized (E, M series).
  * Storage-optimized (L series).
  * GPU (NC, ND, NV series).
* **Scaling**:

  * Manual scaling ‚Üí Add/remove VMs manually.
  * Autoscaling via **VM Scale Sets**.
* **Availability**:

  * **Availability Set**: Logical grouping across multiple fault domains (power, cooling) and update domains (patching). Ensures **99.95% SLA**.
  * **Availability Zone**: Distribute across physically separate datacenters in a region. Ensures **99.99% SLA**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)

* Service to deploy and manage **a group of identical, load-balanced VMs**.
* Supports **autoscaling** based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
* Works with **Azure Load Balancer / App Gateway**.
* Good for stateless workloads (web servers, APIs).

---

## üåê App Services (PaaS for Web & APIs)

* Fully managed platform for hosting **web apps, APIs, and mobile backends**.
* Supports multiple runtimes (C#, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Go).
* Features:

  * Built-in CI/CD integration (GitHub, Azure DevOps).
  * Scaling: manual or auto (App Service Plan).
  * Deployment slots (blue-green, canary).
* SLA: 99.95% uptime.

---

## ‚ö° Azure Functions (Serverless Compute)

* **Event-driven, serverless compute**.
* Supports triggers (HTTP, Blob, Queue, Event Hub, Timer).
* Pay only for execution time (Consumption plan).
* Durable Functions ‚Üí State management, chaining, fan-out/fan-in.
* Good for lightweight, event-driven, microservices scenarios.

---

## üì¶ Azure Container Instances (ACI)

* Run **containers directly without managing servers/VMs**.
* Fast startup, no orchestration overhead.
* Best for burst workloads, testing, or simple microservices.
* Limitations: not good for complex orchestration ‚Üí use AKS instead.

---

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

* Managed Kubernetes service.
* Azure manages control plane (API server, etcd).
* You manage worker nodes and workloads.
* Features:

  * Integration with ACR (Azure Container Registry).
  * Autoscaling (cluster autoscaler, HPA, VPA).
  * RBAC + Azure AD integration.
  * Monitoring (Azure Monitor, Container Insights).
  * Supports multi-AZ, node pools, GPU workloads.
* SLA: 99.95% when deployed with multiple nodes in at least two AZs.

# üéØ Interview Questions & Answers

### Basic

1. **Q: What‚Äôs the difference between Availability Set and Availability Zone?**

   * **A**: Availability Set = multiple fault/update domains inside a single datacenter. Availability Zone = physically separate datacenters within a region. Zones offer higher resiliency.

2. **Q: What is the difference between App Service and Azure Functions?**

   * **A**: App Service = PaaS for hosting web apps/APIs (long-running apps). Azure Functions = event-driven, short-running, serverless execution.

3. **Q: What is Azure Container Instance (ACI) used for?**

   * **A**: Running containers quickly without managing VMs or orchestration. Good for simple or burst workloads.

---

### Intermediate

4. **Q: When would you use VM Scale Sets over App Service?**

   * **A**: Use VMSS when you need full OS control, custom runtime, or workloads not supported in App Service. App Service is better for web APIs with minimal infra management.

5. **Q: How does AKS simplify Kubernetes management?**

   * **A**: Azure manages the control plane (API server, etcd, upgrades), so you only manage worker nodes and applications.

6. **Q: How does scaling differ across services?**

   * **A**:

     * VM ‚Üí manual or VMSS autoscaling.
     * App Service ‚Üí scale up/out with App Service Plan.
     * Azure Functions ‚Üí event-driven autoscaling.
     * AKS ‚Üí HPA/Cluster Autoscaler.

---

### Advanced

7. **Q: How would you design a highly available containerized app in Azure?**

   * **A**: Use AKS across multiple AZs, enable autoscaling, deploy workloads across multiple node pools, use App Gateway + WAF for ingress.

8. **Q: Difference between AKS and ACI integration?**

   * **A**: AKS ‚Üí full orchestration, scaling, monitoring. ACI ‚Üí quick burst compute for jobs. AKS can offload to ACI with **Virtual Nodes** (serverless containers).

9. **Q: What‚Äôs the advantage of using App Service deployment slots?**

   * **A**: Enables blue-green/canary deployments. You can test in staging and swap to production with zero downtime.

# üõ† Scenario-Based Q\&A

1. **Scenario**: You need to run a website with unpredictable traffic spikes. What service do you choose?

   * **Answer**: Azure App Service with autoscaling OR Azure Functions if it‚Äôs API/event-driven.

2. **Scenario**: Your ML model needs GPUs and custom drivers. Which service would you pick?

   * **Answer**: Azure Virtual Machine (GPU series) or AKS node pool with GPU VMs (for containerized workloads).

3. **Scenario**: Your company wants to modernize a monolithic app into microservices. Which Azure compute option fits?

   * **Answer**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) ‚Üí container orchestration, microservices deployment, autoscaling.

4. **Scenario**: You need to process millions of messages from Event Hub and store results in Cosmos DB. Which compute service?

   * **Answer**: Azure Functions with Event Hub trigger ‚Üí serverless scaling per event.

5. **Scenario**: You have 200 identical web servers, and they need to scale automatically with CPU usage. Which service?

   * **Answer**: Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) with Load Balancer.

‚ö° Nishant, do you want me to continue in this **structured style** for the rest of the Azure core services (Networking, Storage, Databases, Security, Monitoring, DevOps, etc.) so you‚Äôll have a **full interview-ready Azure playbook**?
