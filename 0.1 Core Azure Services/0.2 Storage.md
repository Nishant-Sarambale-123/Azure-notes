Got it 👍 Let’s cover **💾 Azure Storage** in the same structured way: **Detailed Notes → Interview Q\&A (basic → advanced) → Scenario Q\&A**.

# 💾 Core Azure Services – Storage

## 📦 Storage Account Types

* **Storage Account** = Top-level namespace for Azure storage services.
* Types:

  1. **General-purpose v2 (GPv2)** – ✅ Recommended

     * Supports **all services**: Blob, File, Queue, Table, Disks.
     * Supports access tiers (hot, cool, archive).
  2. **Blob Storage Account**

     * Optimized only for blob storage. Rarely used (GPv2 is better).
  3. **File Storage Account**

     * Specialized for large-scale file shares (premium only).
  4. **BlockBlobStorage / Premium Storage Accounts**

     * For workloads needing **low latency, high throughput** (databases, VM disks).

---

## 🗂️ Blob Storage (Object Storage)

* Stores **unstructured data**: text, images, videos, backups, logs.
* Container → Blob hierarchy.
* **Blob types**:

  * Block Blob (large files, streaming).
  * Append Blob (logs, telemetry).
  * Page Blob (VM disks).
* **Access Tiers**:

  * **Hot**: Frequently accessed data (higher cost, lower access latency).
  * **Cool**: Infrequently accessed (lower cost, higher access latency, minimum 30 days).
  * **Archive**: Rarely accessed (cheapest, retrieval takes hours, minimum 180 days).

---

## 📁 Azure Files (SMB/NFS)

* Fully managed file shares in the cloud.
* Protocols: **SMB (Windows/Linux)** and **NFS (Linux)**.
* Supports:

  * Mounting file share from **on-prem or cloud VMs**.
  * **Azure File Sync** → cache Azure Files locally on Windows servers.
  * Premium tier for low-latency workloads.

---

## 💽 Disk Storage

* Persistent block storage for Azure VMs.
* **Managed Disks** = Azure manages storage accounts → simplifies scaling, reliability.
* Types:

  * **Standard HDD** → low-cost, dev/test, backup.
  * **Standard SSD** → balanced, low latency, mid-tier prod.
  * **Premium SSD** → high IOPS/low latency (SQL, SAP, critical workloads).
  * **Ultra SSD** → sub-millisecond latency, up to 160,000 IOPS (big databases, OLTP).
* Features:

  * Snapshots, encryption (at rest & in transit), bursting for Premium SSDs.

# 🎯 Interview Questions & Answers

### Basic

1. **Q: What’s the difference between Blob, File, Queue, and Table storage?**

   * **A**:

     * Blob = Object storage for unstructured data.
     * File = SMB/NFS file shares.
     * Queue = Messaging between apps.
     * Table = NoSQL key-value store.

2. **Q: What are the access tiers in Blob storage?**

   * **A**: Hot (frequent access), Cool (infrequent, ≥30 days), Archive (rare, ≥180 days, retrieval hours).

3. **Q: What’s the difference between Availability Set and Managed Disk?**

   * **A**: Availability Set = VM redundancy. Managed Disk = Simplifies VM storage management (no manual storage account handling).

---

### Intermediate

4. **Q: When would you choose Azure Files over Blob Storage?**

   * **A**: Azure Files is for SMB/NFS access (shared file system). Blob is object storage (REST API, unstructured).

5. **Q: What are Ultra SSDs used for?**

   * **A**: High IOPS, low latency workloads like high-performance databases (SQL, SAP HANA, OLTP).

6. **Q: How does Azure File Sync help hybrid scenarios?**

   * **A**: Keeps a local cache of frequently used files on-prem, syncs back to Azure Files.

---

### Advanced

7. **Q: How would you optimize cost for storing 10 years of logs?**

   * **A**: Use Blob storage with **lifecycle management policy** → move from Hot → Cool → Archive based on age.

8. **Q: Difference between Block Blob and Page Blob?**

   * **A**: Block Blob = large file uploads (media). Page Blob = random read/write (VM disks).

9. **Q: How does Managed Disk improve scalability compared to unmanaged disks?**

   * **A**: Managed Disks remove storage account limits (20,000 IOPS/account). Azure handles distribution, scaling, HA automatically.

# 🛠 Scenario-Based Q\&A

1. **Scenario**: You need to store images and videos for a public website, with millions of requests/day. Which storage?

   * **Answer**: Blob storage (Hot tier) with CDN for caching.

2. **Scenario**: Your company runs a legacy app that needs SMB file shares but wants cloud storage. Solution?

   * **Answer**: Azure Files with SMB protocol. If on-prem, use **Azure File Sync**.

3. **Scenario**: You need to host VM disks with 100,000+ IOPS. Which disk type?

   * **Answer**: **Ultra SSD Managed Disk**.

4. **Scenario**: You want to reduce storage cost for old data (>1 year). How?

   * **Answer**: Use **Blob Lifecycle Management** → auto move to Cool/Archive tier.

5. **Scenario**: A company needs to migrate file servers to Azure but still wants local access for branch offices. What do you suggest?

   * **Answer**: Azure Files + Azure File Sync → keeps cache locally, syncs to cloud.

⚡ Nishant, do you want me to continue next with **Azure Networking (VNet, Subnets, NSG, Peering, Load Balancers, App Gateway, VPN, ExpressRoute, etc.)** in the same style so you’ll have a **full end-to-end Azure interview prep kit**?
