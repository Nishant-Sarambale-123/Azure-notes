Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs go deep into **üåê Azure Networking**.
I‚Äôll keep the same format: **Detailed Notes ‚Üí Interview Q\&A (Basic ‚Üí Advanced) ‚Üí Scenario Q\&A**.

# üåê Core Azure Services ‚Äì Networking

## üõ†Ô∏è Virtual Network (VNet)

* Logical **isolation of Azure resources** in the cloud.
* Similar to on-premises network.
* Features:

  * Private IP ranges (RFC1918).
  * Communication between Azure resources (VMs, databases, etc.).
  * Secure connection to on-premises via VPN/ExpressRoute.
  * **Peering** ‚Üí connects VNets across regions/subscriptions.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Subnets & NSG (Network Security Group)

* **Subnets** ‚Üí Divide a VNet into smaller IP ranges. Each subnet hosts resources (VMs, App services, etc.).
* **NSG (Network Security Group)**

  * Firewall-like rules (allow/deny inbound/outbound).
  * Rules based on: source/destination IP, port, protocol.
  * Can be applied to subnet or NIC level.

---

## üîó VPN Gateway & ExpressRoute

* **VPN Gateway**

  * Connects on-prem network to Azure via **IPsec VPN tunnels**.
  * Works over the internet (encrypted).
  * Types: **Site-to-Site**, **Point-to-Site**, **VNet-to-VNet**.

* **ExpressRoute**

  * **Private dedicated connection** between on-prem and Azure.
  * Higher reliability, speed (50 Mbps to 10 Gbps), lower latency.
  * Doesn‚Äôt go over public internet.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer vs Application Gateway

* **Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4 ‚Äì TCP/UDP)**

  * Distributes traffic across VMs in a backend pool.
  * Works at transport layer (no SSL termination).
  * Types: Internal LB (within VNet), Public LB (internet-facing).
  * Supports NAT rules, HA ports.

* **Azure Application Gateway (Layer 7 ‚Äì HTTP/HTTPS)**

  * Works at application layer.
  * Supports **SSL termination, URL-based routing, session affinity, Web Application Firewall (WAF)**.
  * Best for web apps/APIs.

---

## üåç Traffic Manager (DNS-based Global Load Balancing)

* **DNS-level routing** to distribute traffic across multiple endpoints/regions.
* Methods:

  * Priority (active-passive).
  * Weighted (percentage-based split).
  * Performance (closest endpoint by latency).
  * Geographic (user location based).
* Works well with **global HA + DR**.

---

## üî• Azure Firewall & DDoS Protection

* **Azure Firewall**

  * Managed firewall service.
  * Features: FQDN filtering, rules by application/port/IP, threat intelligence.
  * Integrates with **NSG** (NSG = local filtering, Firewall = centralized control).

* **DDoS Protection**

  * **Basic**: Always-on, free, protects against common L3/L4 attacks.
  * **Standard**: Paid, provides enhanced protection, attack analytics, cost protection.
  * Works with VNets, protects public IPs from large-scale attacks.

# üéØ Interview Questions & Answers

### Basic

1. **Q: What is the difference between a VNet and a subnet?**

   * **A**: VNet = full virtual network in Azure. Subnet = logical division of VNet into smaller IP ranges.

2. **Q: What does an NSG do?**

   * **A**: Acts like a firewall for Azure resources, controlling inbound/outbound traffic.

3. **Q: Difference between VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute?**

   * **A**: VPN = encrypted tunnel over internet (cheaper, slower). ExpressRoute = dedicated private connection (faster, reliable, expensive).

---

### Intermediate

4. **Q: Difference between Load Balancer and Application Gateway?**

   * **A**: LB works at L4 (TCP/UDP), distributes traffic by IP/port. App Gateway works at L7 (HTTP/HTTPS), supports SSL offload, URL routing, WAF.

5. **Q: How does Traffic Manager differ from Load Balancer?**

   * **A**: Traffic Manager = DNS-based, global, routes traffic between regions. Load Balancer = actual packet distribution inside a region.

6. **Q: How do NSGs and Azure Firewall differ?**

   * **A**: NSG = basic, local subnet/NIC-level filtering. Firewall = centralized, advanced filtering with threat intelligence, logging.

---

### Advanced

7. **Q: How do you design a multi-region highly available application in Azure?**

   * **A**: Deploy across multiple regions, use Traffic Manager for DNS-level routing, Application Gateway/WAF per region, and ExpressRoute/VPN for hybrid connectivity.

8. **Q: When would you choose DDoS Standard over Basic?**

   * **A**: For mission-critical apps exposed to internet with SLA requirements ‚Üí Standard provides advanced protection, telemetry, cost protection.

9. **Q: What‚Äôs the role of VNet Peering?**

   * **A**: Connects two VNets for private communication across regions/subscriptions, with low latency and high bandwidth.

# üõ† Scenario-Based Q\&A

1. **Scenario**: Your web app must be resilient across Europe and Asia. How do you distribute traffic?

   * **Answer**: Use **Traffic Manager** (performance routing) + **Application Gateway (WAF)** in each region.

2. **Scenario**: You have VMs in a subnet, but they should only accept traffic from App Gateway, not directly from the internet. Solution?

   * **Answer**: Apply **NSG rules** to allow traffic only from App Gateway‚Äôs subnet IP.

3. **Scenario**: A bank requires private, low-latency connectivity from on-prem to Azure. VPN is not enough. What do you choose?

   * **Answer**: **ExpressRoute** with redundant circuits.

4. **Scenario**: You need to protect against SQL injection and XSS attacks on your web apps. What Azure service helps?

   * **Answer**: **Application Gateway with WAF enabled**.

5. **Scenario**: A company has 50 VNets across different subscriptions. They need centralized traffic filtering. What should they use?

   * **Answer**: **Azure Firewall** with VNet Peering/Hub-Spoke architecture.

6. **Scenario**: Your global app is under a huge DDoS attack. How does Azure help?

   * **Answer**: **DDoS Protection Standard** absorbs and mitigates large-scale L3/L4 attacks automatically, with attack reports.

‚ö° Nishant, do you want me to take **Databases (Cosmos DB, SQL Database, Managed Instance, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)** next, or should I move to **Security & Identity (Azure AD, RBAC, Managed Identities, Key Vault, Policies)** in the same structured way?
