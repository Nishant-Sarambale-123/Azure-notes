# 📊 Monitoring & Management in Azure

## 📡 Azure Monitor

* **Central monitoring platform** for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry.
* Data sources: Metrics (numerical, near real-time), Logs (structured/unstructured events).
* Provides **alerting, dashboards, autoscale triggers**.
* Integrates with Log Analytics, Application Insights, Service Health.

---

## 📑 Log Analytics

* **Query & analysis tool** built on top of **Azure Monitor Logs**.
* Uses **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**.
* Collects logs from VMs, apps, Azure services, on-prem resources.
* Example: Query failed requests, CPU usage trends, security events.

---

## 📈 Application Insights

* APM (**Application Performance Monitoring**) service.
* Features:

  * Monitor app availability, performance, failures, dependencies.
  * Supports multiple languages (.NET, Java, Node.js, Python).
  * Provides distributed tracing (see request flow across services).
  * Auto-instrumentation available for many platforms.

---

## 🧠 Azure Advisor

* **Recommendation engine** for best practices in:

  * Cost (unused resources, reserved instances).
  * Security (enable MFA, update NSGs).
  * Performance (resize VMs, caching suggestions).
  * Reliability (availability sets/zones).
* Helps optimize resources proactively.

---

## ❤️ Service Health & Resource Health

* **Service Health**:

  * Personalized dashboard for Azure service incidents, outages, planned maintenance.
  * Subscription-wide view.
* **Resource Health**:

  * Status of **your specific resources** (VM, SQL, Storage).
  * Tells if an issue is due to Azure or your configuration.

# 🎯 Interview Questions & Answers

### Basic

1. **Q: What’s the difference between Azure Monitor and Log Analytics?**

   * **A**: Azure Monitor = umbrella monitoring platform. Log Analytics = query engine (KQL) for analyzing log data collected by Azure Monitor.

2. **Q: What does Application Insights provide?**

   * **A**: App-level telemetry: request rates, response times, failures, dependency calls, distributed tracing, user analytics.

3. **Q: What does Azure Advisor do?**

   * **A**: Provides best-practice recommendations for cost, performance, reliability, and security.

---

### Intermediate

4. **Q: How do you collect performance metrics from VMs in Azure?**

   * **A**: Enable VM diagnostics → send data to **Azure Monitor** → analyze with **Log Analytics**.

5. **Q: What is the difference between Service Health and Resource Health?**

   * **A**: Service Health = overall Azure service outages/maintenance. Resource Health = health of individual customer resources.

6. **Q: How do you integrate Azure Monitor with external systems like Splunk or ServiceNow?**

   * **A**: Via **Azure Monitor Diagnostic Settings** → export logs/metrics to Event Hub, Log Analytics, or Storage, then forward to external systems.

---

### Advanced

7. **Q: How would you troubleshoot high latency in a cloud app?**

   * **A**: Use **Application Insights** (distributed tracing, dependency maps), check **Log Analytics** for performance counters, correlate with **Azure Monitor metrics** (CPU, memory, network).

8. **Q: How do you implement proactive monitoring in Azure?**

   * **A**: Create **Azure Monitor Alerts**, set up **Action Groups** (email, webhook, ITSM integration), use **Azure Advisor** for continuous improvements.

9. **Q: What role does KQL play in Azure monitoring?**

   * **A**: It’s the query language for analyzing logs in Log Analytics; powerful for troubleshooting, trend analysis, anomaly detection.

# 🛠 Scenario-Based Q\&A

1. **Scenario**: Your web app is slow, users complain about timeouts. How do you investigate?

   * **Answer**: Enable **Application Insights** → check request/response times, failures, dependency issues. Use **distributed tracing** to find bottlenecks.

2. **Scenario**: A VM keeps restarting. How do you check if it’s an Azure issue or VM config issue?

   * **Answer**: Check **Resource Health**. If "Platform initiated," it’s Azure’s fault; if "User initiated" or OS crash, it’s customer-side.

3. **Scenario**: Management wants to reduce cloud costs. What tool do you use?

   * **Answer**: **Azure Advisor** for cost recommendations (unused VMs, resizing, reserved instances).

4. **Scenario**: A critical workload must be monitored for CPU > 80% for more than 5 minutes. What do you set up?

   * **Answer**: **Azure Monitor Metric Alert** with threshold + **Action Group** (email/Teams/webhook).

5. **Scenario**: During an outage, how do you check if it’s a regional Azure problem?

   * **Answer**: Use **Azure Service Health** dashboard for incident status and root cause analysis.

⚡ Nishant, do you want me to move next to **5. DevOps & CI/CD (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Pipelines, IaC)**, or should I cover **6. Governance & Compliance (Policy, Blueprints, Cost Management, Tags)** after Monitoring?
