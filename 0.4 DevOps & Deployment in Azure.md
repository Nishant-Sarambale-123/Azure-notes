# üöÄ DevOps & Deployment in Azure

## üõ† Azure DevOps

A suite of DevOps services from Microsoft.

* **Repos** ‚Äì Git repositories for version control (similar to GitHub).
* **Pipelines** ‚Äì CI/CD pipelines (build, test, deploy apps). Supports YAML & classic UI.
* **Boards** ‚Äì Agile project management (sprints, Kanban, backlog).
* **Artifacts** ‚Äì Package management (NuGet, npm, Maven, PyPI).
* **Test Plans** ‚Äì Manual & automated testing management.

---

## üêô GitHub Actions for CI/CD in Azure

* Automates **build, test, deploy** workflows directly in GitHub.
* Workflows defined in **YAML files** (`.github/workflows/`).
* Supports **self-hosted runners** (on-prem/VMs) or GitHub-hosted runners.
* Azure integration:

  * Deploy to **App Services**, **AKS**, **VMs**.
  * Use **Azure Login Action** (OIDC authentication with Azure AD).
  * Can replace or complement Azure Pipelines.

---

## üèó Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Manage Azure resources via code, not manual portal clicks.

* **ARM Templates**:

  * JSON-based, native IaC for Azure.
  * Declarative, idempotent.
* **Bicep**:

  * Domain-specific language (DSL) for Azure IaC.
  * Simplifies ARM ‚Üí human-friendly syntax.
* **Terraform**:

  * Cloud-agnostic IaC tool.
  * Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).
  * Supports Azure via `azurerm` provider.
  * State management (local/remote).

## üåê Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment

* Two identical environments:

  * **Blue (current prod)**
  * **Green (new version)**
* Route traffic to **Green** after validation.
* Rollback = switch traffic back to Blue.
* Azure implementation:

  * **App Service Deployment Slots** ‚Üí swap after testing.
  * **AKS** ‚Üí two deployments + update Service routing.

### 2. Canary Deployment

* Gradually roll out new version to a **subset of users**.
* Validate performance & errors before full rollout.
* Azure implementation:

  * **AKS with Argo Rollouts** ‚Üí progressive traffic shifting.
  * **App Service traffic splitting** ‚Üí % traffic to new slot.

# üéØ Interview Questions & Answers

### Basic

1. **Q: What‚Äôs the difference between Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions?**

   * **A**: Both are CI/CD tools. Azure Pipelines = part of Azure DevOps, integrates deeply with enterprise workflows. GitHub Actions = integrated with GitHub repos, YAML-first, lightweight.

2. **Q: What is Infrastructure as Code? Why use it?**

   * **A**: IaC = managing infrastructure via code (ARM, Bicep, Terraform). Benefits: version control, repeatability, automation, consistency.

3. **Q: What are Deployment Slots in Azure App Service?**

   * **A**: Separate environments (staging/prod). You deploy to staging, test, then **swap slots** for zero-downtime deployment.

---

### Intermediate

4. **Q: How does Bicep improve over ARM templates?**

   * **A**: Human-readable syntax, modularity, easier to maintain. Compiles down to ARM.

5. **Q: What is the advantage of Terraform over ARM/Bicep?**

   * **A**: Cloud-agnostic, supports multiple providers, strong community, powerful state management.

6. **Q: How does GitHub Actions authenticate with Azure?**

   * **A**: Using **OIDC-based Azure Login Action** (workload identity federation), avoids storing service principal secrets.

---

### Advanced

7. **Q: Compare Blue-Green vs Canary deployments.**

   * **A**:

     * Blue-Green ‚Üí instant switch, safer rollback, needs duplicate infra.
     * Canary ‚Üí gradual rollout, safer for large user base, but more complex monitoring.

8. **Q: How do you achieve zero-downtime deployments in Azure?**

   * **A**: Use **App Service Deployment Slots**, **AKS rolling updates**, or **Blue-Green deployment strategies**.

9. **Q: How would you handle secrets in Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions?**

   * **A**: Store secrets in **Azure Key Vault**, integrate with pipeline, access via **Managed Identity**.

# üõ† Scenario-Based Q\&A

1. **Scenario**: You need to deploy a new version of an API without downtime. How?

   * **Answer**: Use **App Service Deployment Slots (Blue-Green)** ‚Üí deploy to staging slot, test, then swap.

2. **Scenario**: You want to gradually test new microservice versions in AKS with 10% traffic first. Solution?

   * **Answer**: Use **Canary deployment** ‚Üí AKS + Ingress Controller with weighted routing (or Argo Rollouts).

3. **Scenario**: Your company manages multi-cloud infra (Azure + AWS). Which IaC tool would you use?

   * **Answer**: **Terraform** ‚Üí cloud-agnostic, supports both Azure (`azurerm`) and AWS (`aws`) providers.

4. **Scenario**: You need to enforce infra standards across multiple teams. Which tool helps?

   * **Answer**: Use **Bicep/ARM templates** with **Azure Policy & Blueprints** to enforce compliance.

5. **Scenario**: You want to migrate an existing app repo in GitHub to Azure. Which CI/CD option do you pick?

   * **Answer**: Prefer **GitHub Actions** (since code is in GitHub) for simplicity. If enterprise setup with Boards/Artifacts is required ‚Üí use **Azure Pipelines**.
