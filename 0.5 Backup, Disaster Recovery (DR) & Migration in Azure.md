# 🔄 Backup, DR & Migration in Azure

## 💾 Azure Backup

* **Fully managed backup service** → replaces on-prem tape/disk backup solutions.
* Supports:

  * Azure VMs (entire VM or specific disks).
  * SQL Server in Azure VM.
  * Azure Files (file share backup).
  * On-prem servers (via **MARS agent** or **Azure Backup Server**).
* Features:

  * Application-consistent backups (with VSS integration).
  * Retention policies (short-term & long-term).
  * Incremental backups to save cost & bandwidth.
  * Encryption at rest (AES-256) & in transit.
* Recovery Options: Entire VM restore, file-level recovery, or point-in-time restore for DBs.

## 🌪 Azure Site Recovery (ASR) – Disaster Recovery

* Provides **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCDR)**.
* Replicates workloads to another Azure region or on-prem → failover when primary site is unavailable.
* Supports:

  * Azure VMs → another region.
  * On-prem VMware/Hyper-V → Azure.
  * Physical servers → Azure.
* Features:

  * **RPO/RTO targets** (near zero for critical apps).
  * **Test failovers** without impacting production.
  * **Failback** to primary region after recovery.
* Difference from Backup:

  * **Backup = Data protection** (long-term).
  * **ASR = Continuity** (keep apps running during outages).

## 🚚 Azure Migrate

* Helps migrate **on-prem workloads to Azure**.
* Provides **discovery, assessment, and migration tools**.
* Components:

  * **Server Migration** → VMware/Hyper-V/Physical → Azure.
  * **Database Migration Service (DMS)** → SQL, Oracle, MySQL → Azure SQL/Managed Instance.
  * **Web App Migration Assistant** → IIS, ASP.NET → Azure App Service.
  * **VDI Migration** → On-prem VDI to Azure Virtual Desktop.
* Features:

  * Performance-based sizing recommendations.
  * Cost estimation (Azure pricing calculator integration).
  * Integration with ASR for “lift-and-shift” migrations.

# 🎯 Interview Questions & Answers

### Basic

1. **Q: What is the difference between Azure Backup and Site Recovery?**

   * **A**: Backup = protects **data** (restore files/VMs/DBs). Site Recovery = ensures **business continuity** by failing over entire workloads to secondary region.

2. **Q: How does Azure Backup save storage costs?**

   * **A**: Uses incremental backups (only changes are saved), retention policies, and compression.

3. **Q: What is Azure Migrate used for?**

   * **A**: For discovering, assessing, and migrating on-prem workloads (servers, databases, apps) to Azure.

### Intermediate

4. **Q: Can you back up Azure Files with Azure Backup?**

   * **A**: Yes, Azure Backup supports file share backup with snapshots and recovery options.

5. **Q: What’s the difference between RPO and RTO in DR?**

   * **A**:

     * **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** → how much data you can afford to lose (time gap between last backup and failure).
     * **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** → how quickly you need apps restored after failure.

6. **Q: How does Site Recovery perform a failover test without downtime?**

   * **A**: It supports **Test Failover** to a test network (isolated), so apps can be validated without affecting production.

---

### Advanced

7. **Q: How would you migrate a large on-prem SQL Server database to Azure with minimal downtime?**

   * **A**: Use **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)** with online migration (continuous replication) → cutover during planned downtime.

8. **Q: How do you handle compliance requirements for 7+ years of backup retention?**

   * **A**: Use **Azure Backup Vault** with long-term retention policies (e.g., monthly/yearly snapshots).

9. **Q: How can you ensure DR for a multi-tier app (Web + DB) in Azure?**

   * **A**: Use **ASR to replicate VMs** across regions, configure recovery plans (boot order: DB → App → Web).

# 🛠 Scenario-Based Q\&A

1. **Scenario**: A company wants to protect its on-prem file server data in Azure for 10 years. What service to use?

   * **Answer**: Use **Azure Backup with MARS agent**, configure **long-term retention**.

2. **Scenario**: Your app must keep running even if the primary Azure region goes down. How do you ensure this?

   * **Answer**: Use **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** → replicate workloads to secondary region, failover automatically.

3. **Scenario**: You need to migrate 100 on-prem VMware VMs to Azure. What’s the best approach?

   * **Answer**: Use **Azure Migrate** (discovery + assessment) → **Server Migration** → replicate VMs → cutover to Azure.

4. **Scenario**: During a planned migration, DB downtime must be less than 30 minutes. What’s the approach?

   * **Answer**: Use **Azure DMS with online migration** → continuous sync until cutover → minimal downtime switch.

5. **Scenario**: An audit requires proof that backups are encrypted. How do you handle this?

   * **Answer**: Show that Azure Backup uses **AES-256 encryption at rest**, TLS in transit, and optionally customer-managed keys.

⚡ Nishant, next in your Azure checklist should be **7. Governance & Compliance (Policy, Blueprints, Tags, Cost Management, Locks)**.
Do you want me to prepare that in the same structured way?
