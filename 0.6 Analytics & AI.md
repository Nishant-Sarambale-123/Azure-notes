# ðŸ“˜ 7. Analytics & AI

---

## ðŸ“’ Detailed Notes

### **1. Azure Synapse Analytics (Data Warehouse)**

* A cloud-based **analytics service** for big data and data warehousing.
* Integrates with **Power BI** for visualization.
* Supports both **serverless SQL** (pay per query) and **dedicated SQL pools** (reserved compute).
* Used for querying petabyte-scale data, analytics, and reporting.
* Can ingest data from **Data Lake, Cosmos DB, Blob, on-prem, and external sources**.

---

### **2. Azure Data Factory (ETL/ELT Pipelines)**

* A **cloud ETL service** to move, transform, and orchestrate data workflows.
* Uses **pipelines and activities** (like copy data, transformations).
* Integrates with **on-premises and cloud data sources**.
* Supports **mapping data flows** for transformations without coding.
* Often used to load data into **Synapse, Data Lake, or Databricks**.

---

### **3. Azure Databricks (Big Data + ML)**

* Apache Spark-based **data analytics & machine learning platform**.
* Scalable for **big data processing, data science, and AI model training**.
* Integrates tightly with **Data Lake, Synapse, and ML Studio**.
* Supports **Python, Scala, R, Java, and SQL** for analytics.
* Used for **real-time streaming analytics** as well.

---

### **4. Cognitive Services (AI APIs)**

* Pre-built **AI services** for developers.
* Categories:

  * **Vision** â†’ OCR, Face recognition, Image classification.
  * **Speech** â†’ Speech-to-text, Text-to-speech, Translation.
  * **Language (NLP)** â†’ Sentiment analysis, QnA maker, Translator.
  * **Decision** â†’ Personalizer (recommendation engine), Anomaly Detector.
* Allows quick integration of AI without building custom ML models.

---

### **5. Azure Machine Learning Studio (ML Ops)**

* End-to-end **machine learning platform**.
* Provides **no-code designer** (drag-and-drop ML) and **Python SDK** for ML pipelines.
* Supports **AutoML** (automated model training & tuning).
* Can **deploy ML models** as REST APIs.
* Integrates with **DevOps, GitHub, AKS, and Azure Functions** for production ML (MLOps).

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Questions & Answers

### **Q1. What is the difference between Synapse and Databricks?**

**Answer:**

* **Synapse** â†’ Best for **structured data** (data warehouse, SQL queries, reporting).
* **Databricks** â†’ Best for **big data + AI/ML**, unstructured & semi-structured data, advanced analytics.
* They are complementary: Data can flow from **Data Lake â†’ Databricks (clean/transform) â†’ Synapse (reporting)**.

---

### **Q2. How does Data Factory differ from Databricks?**

**Answer:**

* **Data Factory** = Orchestration + Data movement (ETL/ELT pipelines).
* **Databricks** = Advanced data processing + AI/ML.
* Example: ADF loads raw data â†’ Databricks cleans & enriches â†’ Synapse analyzes.

---

### **Q3. What is Cognitive Services and when would you use it?**

**Answer:**

* A set of **pre-built AI APIs** for Vision, Speech, Language, and Decision-making.
* Used when you want **AI features without training ML models**.
* Example: Adding OCR or sentiment analysis to an app.

---

### **Q4. What is AutoML in Azure ML Studio?**

**Answer:**

* AutoML = Automated Machine Learning â†’ lets Azure automatically test multiple ML algorithms and hyperparameters to pick the best-performing model.
* Saves time for data scientists and improves accuracy.

---

### **Q5. Explain serverless SQL in Synapse.**

**Answer:**

* Serverless SQL in Synapse allows running **on-demand queries** directly on files in **Data Lake (CSV, Parquet, JSON)** without needing to provision compute.
* Pay **per query** instead of paying for reserved compute.

---

## ðŸ›  Scenario-Based Questions & Answers

### **Scenario 1: You have petabytes of sales data. How do you analyze it in Azure?**

* Use **Azure Data Lake** to store raw data.
* Use **Data Factory** to orchestrate ingestion from multiple sources.
* Use **Databricks** for cleansing, enrichment, and ML predictions (e.g., customer churn).
* Use **Synapse** for reporting + Power BI dashboards.

---

### **Scenario 2: You need to add AI-driven translation to a web app. What would you use?**

* Use **Cognitive Services â†’ Translator API** to add multilingual support without training models.

---

### **Scenario 3: Your retail company wants to recommend products to users like Amazon. Which service helps?**

* Use **Cognitive Services â€“ Personalizer API** for real-time recommendations.
* Or build a **custom ML model** in **Azure ML Studio + Databricks** if business needs more control.

---

### **Scenario 4: You want to deploy an ML model for fraud detection. How do you handle it?**

* Train model in **Azure ML Studio / Databricks**.
* Register model in **Azure ML registry**.
* Deploy to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** or **Azure Container Instances (ACI)** as a REST API.
* Use **Azure Monitor + App Insights** for monitoring model performance (MLOps).
