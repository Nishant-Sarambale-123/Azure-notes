# üìò 8. Cost Management

---

## üìí Detailed Notes

### **1. Pricing Calculator & TCO Calculator**

* **Pricing Calculator** ‚Üí Lets you **estimate monthly cost** of Azure services before deploying.

  * Example: Choose VM size, storage, bandwidth ‚Üí get estimated cost.
* **TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) Calculator** ‚Üí Compares **on-premises vs Azure costs** (hardware, power, cooling, staff vs cloud pay-as-you-go).

  * Useful for **CFOs & migration decisions**.

---

### **2. Budgets & Alerts**

* **Budgets**: Set **spending limits** for subscriptions/resource groups.
* **Alerts**: Triggered when spending reaches threshold (e.g., 80% of budget).
* Integrated with **Azure Cost Management + Billing**.
* Prevents **bill shocks** by notifying teams early.

---

### **3. Reserved Instances (RI) vs Spot Instances**

* **Reserved Instances (RI):**

  * Commit to **1-year or 3-year term** for VMs, SQL, Cosmos DB.
  * Up to **72% cheaper** than pay-as-you-go.
  * Good for **predictable workloads** (e.g., production app servers).

* **Spot Instances:**

  * Use **unused Azure capacity** at deep discounts (up to 90%).
  * Can be **evicted anytime** if Azure needs resources.
  * Good for **non-critical, batch, or test workloads**.

---

### **4. Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB)**

* Lets you use **existing on-premises Windows Server or SQL Server licenses** with Software Assurance on Azure.
* Saves up to **40% on VM and SQL costs**.
* Example: If you already own SQL Server licenses, you don‚Äôt pay for them again on Azure VMs.

## üéØ Interview Questions & Answers

### **Q1. How do you estimate Azure costs before deployment?**

**Answer:**

* Use **Azure Pricing Calculator** to estimate monthly cost.
* Use **TCO Calculator** to compare on-prem vs cloud cost.

---

### **Q2. What‚Äôs the difference between Reserved Instances and Spot Instances?**

**Answer:**

* **Reserved Instances** = Long-term commitment (1‚Äì3 years), stable and predictable workloads, high savings (up to 72%).
* **Spot Instances** = Cheap but **evictable anytime**, best for test or batch workloads.

---

### **Q3. How do you control costs in Azure?**

**Answer:**

* Use **Budgets & Alerts** in Azure Cost Management.
* Optimize resources with **Azure Advisor**.
* Use **Reserved Instances** or **Spot VMs** for discounts.
* Apply **Auto-scaling** and **shutdown schedules** for dev/test environments.

---

### **Q4. What is Azure Hybrid Benefit and why is it useful?**

**Answer:**

* A licensing benefit that allows reusing **on-prem Windows Server/SQL licenses** on Azure.
* Reduces VM and SQL costs significantly (up to 40%).
* Useful for companies with large existing Microsoft license investments.

---

### **Q5. How do you handle cost anomalies in Azure?**

**Answer:**

* Set up **budgets + alerts** for sudden spikes.
* Use **Cost Analysis in Azure Cost Management** to check resource usage.
* Use **tags** to identify which team/project caused the anomaly.

---

## üõ† Scenario-Based Questions & Answers

### **Scenario 1: Your company got an unexpected \$20,000 Azure bill. What steps would you take?**

* Check **Cost Analysis** to identify services/resources causing spike.
* Verify if **autoscaling** or **unplanned deployments** caused it.
* Review **tags** to trace cost back to teams/projects.
* Implement **budgets + alerts** to prevent recurrence.

---

### **Scenario 2: A production workload runs 24/7 for 3 years. How do you optimize cost?**

* Use **Reserved Instances (3-year)** for stable workloads ‚Üí \~72% savings.
* Apply **Azure Hybrid Benefit** if company already has Windows/SQL licenses.

---

### **Scenario 3: You have a data science team that runs experiments only at night. How do you reduce cost?**

* Use **Spot VMs** for training models (since jobs can be interrupted).
* Configure **shutdown schedules** or **auto-scaling** to stop VMs when not in use.

---

### **Scenario 4: CFO asks you to justify Azure spend compared to on-prem. What tool do you use?**

* Use **TCO Calculator** to show total cost difference.
* Highlight **savings on hardware, power, maintenance, staff** vs Azure pay-as-you-go model.
