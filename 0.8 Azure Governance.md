---

## üìí Detailed Notes

### **1. Tags for Resources**

* **Tags** = key-value pairs assigned to resources for **organization, tracking, and cost management**.
* Example: `Environment: Production`, `Project: WebsiteRedesign`, `Owner: TeamA`.
* Benefits:

  * Resource grouping (across subscriptions/resource groups).
  * Reporting & cost allocation.
  * Automation (scripts can query resources based on tags).
* Best practice: Define **standardized tag naming conventions**.

---

### **2. Azure Policy (Compliance)**

* **Azure Policy** = ensures resources comply with company standards & regulations.
* Examples:

  * Enforce **allowed VM SKUs**.
  * Restrict **locations** where resources can be deployed.
  * Require **tagging of all resources**.
* Key components:

  * **Definition** ‚Üí What policy does.
  * **Assignment** ‚Üí Scope: subscription, resource group, management group.
  * **Compliance evaluation** ‚Üí Tracks if resources are compliant.

---

### **3. Blueprints (Governance Templates)**

* **Blueprints** = combine multiple governance artifacts (policies, role assignments, resource groups) into a **repeatable deployment template**.
* Purpose: Deploy **fully governed environments** quickly.
* Example: New dev environment blueprint includes:

  * Predefined resource groups
  * Policies (enforce tags & allowed regions)
  * RBAC role assignments

---

### **4. Locks (Read-only/Delete Protection)**

* Prevent accidental changes or deletions of critical resources.
* Types:

  * **CanNotDelete** ‚Üí Resource can be modified but **cannot be deleted**.
  * **ReadOnly** ‚Üí Resource can only be read, **no modifications allowed**.
* Applied at **resource, resource group, or subscription level**.

## üéØ Interview Questions & Answers

### **Q1. What are Tags in Azure and why are they important?**

**Answer:**

* Tags = key-value pairs for organizing & tracking resources.
* Important for **cost management, reporting, automation, and governance**.

---

### **Q2. How does Azure Policy enforce compliance?**

**Answer:**

* Define a **policy** (e.g., allowed VM sizes, required tags).
* Assign policy to a **scope** (subscription/resource group).
* Azure evaluates resources and reports **compliance/non-compliance**.

---

### **Q3. What is an Azure Blueprint?**

**Answer:**

* A governance **template** that bundles **policies, role assignments, and resource groups**.
* Enables quick, repeatable deployment of **compliant environments**.

---

### **Q4. Explain the difference between Locks types in Azure.**

**Answer:**

* **CanNotDelete** ‚Üí Prevent deletion, modifications allowed.
* **ReadOnly** ‚Üí Prevent all changes except read.

---

### **Q5. How do Policies and Blueprints work together?**

**Answer:**

* **Policies** enforce rules on resources.
* **Blueprints** bundle policies + RBAC + resources ‚Üí deploy governed environments quickly.

---

## üõ† Scenario-Based Questions & Answers

### **Scenario 1: Your organization wants to ensure all VMs have `Environment` and `Owner` tags. How?**

* **Answer:** Use **Azure Policy** to enforce required tags. Assign it at subscription or management group.

---

### **Scenario 2: You want to deploy a new dev environment with pre-defined RBAC and policies. How?**

* **Answer:** Create a **Blueprint** with resource groups, policies, and role assignments ‚Üí deploy blueprint to subscription.

---

### **Scenario 3: A critical production database should not be deleted accidentally. How do you protect it?**

* **Answer:** Apply a **CanNotDelete lock** at the resource level.

---

### **Scenario 4: Developers are creating resources in unauthorized regions. How do you enforce allowed regions?**

* **Answer:** Use **Azure Policy** ‚Üí define allowed locations ‚Üí assign at subscription/management group.

---

### **Scenario 5: You want to track monthly cost per project across all subscriptions. How?**

* **Answer:** Standardize **tags** (`Project: <Name>`) on all resources ‚Üí use **Cost Management + Cost Analysis** to filter by tag.

‚úÖ That completes **Azure Governance**.

Next, if you want, we can prepare a **full consolidated Azure interview prep sheet** with **all 9 topics**, including **summary tables, common Q\&A, scenario-based questions**, so you have a ready-to-go reference for interviews.

Do you want me to prepare that next?
